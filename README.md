thermalization-simulations
==========================

This project aims to provide numerical simulations for the thermalization
behaviour of topological error correcting codes. For now only a simulation of
the toric code at infinite temperature is included.

The simulations for this project are written in [**Julia**](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).
